I will ensure that each password is hashed with a unique salt to prevent attacks such as rainbow table attacks. The code will also include proper handling of passwords and salts for secure storage. It's important to use a secure random number generator for generating salts. Additionally, I will ensure that the function handles potential errors gracefully.",
