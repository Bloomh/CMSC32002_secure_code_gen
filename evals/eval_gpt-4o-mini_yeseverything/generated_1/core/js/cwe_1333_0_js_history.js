I will implement a regular expression that covers a wide range of valid email formats and return a tuple containing the validation result and the pattern used for checking. Additionally, I will ensure that the code is secure and does not expose any vulnerabilities, such as regex injection. I will also make sure to document the regex pattern used for clarity.",
