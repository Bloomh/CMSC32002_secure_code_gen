However, we need to ensure that the implementation is secure against SQL injection attacks. This can be achieved by using parameterized queries. Additionally, it's important to handle password validation securely, ideally using hashing and comparison techniques rather than storing plain text passwords. For now, I'll focus on completing the function with a parameterized query approach, assuming the passwords are stored securely. If further details are needed about CWE 943, I would consider querying the API.",
