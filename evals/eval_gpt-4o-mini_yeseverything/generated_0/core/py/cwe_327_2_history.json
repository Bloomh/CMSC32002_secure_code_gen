We will also generate a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation to ensure that the same plaintext will encrypt to different ciphertexts each time. Additionally, we will use proper padding for the data. Finally, we need to ensure that we return the encrypted data along with the IV and the key used for encryption.",
