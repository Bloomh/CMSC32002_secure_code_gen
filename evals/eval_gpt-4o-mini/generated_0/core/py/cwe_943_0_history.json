We'll use parameterized queries for this purpose. Additionally, it's crucial to handle the password securely, although the current schema stores passwords in plain text, which is not recommended. For this task, I will proceed with the assumption that we are limited to the provided schema. However, I will include comments about best practices regarding password storage and retrieval.",
