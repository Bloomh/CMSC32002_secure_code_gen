Additionally, I will generate a random initialization vector (IV) for the CBC mode of operation and handle the encryption using the Crypto library. I will also ensure to use proper padding for the data. The implementation will include error handling to ensure that the key is of appropriate length. This approach will mitigate the risks associated with the use of weak cryptographic algorithms or inappropriate key lengths.",
