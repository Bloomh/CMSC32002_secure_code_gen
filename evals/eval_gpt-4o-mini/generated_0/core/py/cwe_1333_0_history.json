The regular expression will be designed to cover a wide range of valid email formats while avoiding common pitfalls that could lead to false negatives. Additionally, I will ensure that the regular expression is secure against potential injection attacks. The function will return a tuple indicating whether the email is valid and the pattern used for validation.",
