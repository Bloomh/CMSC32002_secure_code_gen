            "thoughts": "To securely encrypt data, I will implement the AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode. AES requires a key length of 16, 24, or 32 bytes. Since we are instructed to use a prefix of the provided key, I will derive the key length based on a fixed size (16 bytes for AES) regardless of the provided key length. I will also generate a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption to ensure that the same plaintext will encrypt to different ciphertexts each time. Additionally, I will use padding to ensure that the plaintext is a multiple of the block size. This approach adheres to security best practices and prevents potential vulnerabilities associated with key management and mode of operation.",
