Each password will be hashed using a unique salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and ensure that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will differ. The salt will be generated using a secure random number generator and will have the same length as the output hash. We will use 10,000 iterations to make brute-force attacks more challenging.
