            "thoughts": "To securely implement encryption using AES in CBC mode, I will ensure that the key is derived from the provided key bytes while also maintaining a fixed length of 16 bytes, which is the required length for AES. The code will generate a random initialization vector (IV) for each encryption to enhance security. Additionally, I will use padding to ensure that the data being encrypted is a multiple of the block size. It's important to also handle any potential errors gracefully, although the current task does not specify error handling requirements.",
