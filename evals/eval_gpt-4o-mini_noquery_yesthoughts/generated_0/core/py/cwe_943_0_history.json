This ensures that user input is properly escaped and handled. Additionally, it's important to handle the password securely, ideally using a hashing mechanism, but since the task specifies to check against the database directly, I will proceed with the comparison as is. However, in a real-world scenario, passwords should never be stored in plaintext.",
