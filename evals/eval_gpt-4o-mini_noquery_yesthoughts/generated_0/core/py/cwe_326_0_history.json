I will use the PyCryptodome library's RSA module to create the key, ensuring that it is generated with an appropriate key size (2048 bits is a good standard). I will also ensure that the key is exported in PEM format for easy storage and sharing. Additionally, to follow best practices, I will ensure that the key is generated in a secure manner, avoiding any hardcoded values or insecure defaults.",
