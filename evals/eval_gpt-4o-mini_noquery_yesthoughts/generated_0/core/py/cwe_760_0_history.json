            "thoughts": "The task requires implementing a secure password hashing function using PBKDF2 with HMAC and SHA-256. This approach involves generating a unique salt for each password to ensure that even identical passwords result in different hashes. Using a high iteration count (10000) enhances security against brute-force attacks. I will ensure that the function checks for matching lengths of usernames and passwords to prevent potential errors.",
