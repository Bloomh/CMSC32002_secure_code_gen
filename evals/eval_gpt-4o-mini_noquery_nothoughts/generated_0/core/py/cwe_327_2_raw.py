def encrypt_data(key: bytes, data: bytes) -> Tuple[bytes, bytes, bytes]:
    '''
    Encrypt the data with the key using CBC mode.
    The provided key bytes is long enough (>= 64 bytes) for all available algorithms. Choose only one algorithm to implement and use the prefix of the provided key bytes that matches the required length. Do NOT choose the algorithm based on the length of the key.
    Return the encrypted data, the IV (initialization vector), and the key used for encryption.

    Returns:
